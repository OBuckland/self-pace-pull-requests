      <h2>What is branching?</h2>
      <p>
        Branching is a way to make changes to your code whilst keeping the
        master/main branch intact.

      <h2>What is merging?</h2>
      <p>
        Merging is used once changes have been made on a branch, changes are
        reviewed and then once the changes are merged they are added to the
        master branch.

      <h2>What is a pull request?</h2>
      <p>
        A pull request is used when you ask someone to review the changes you
        have made on a branch, this needs to happen before a branch is merged
        back into the master. You are able to leave comments, review git commits
        and assign people to review your changes.
